# Markdown Editor

**Live app:** https://markdown-editor.sbecka81111.now.sh/

**Link to CodeSandbox:** https://codesandbox.io/s/markdown-editor-by-sabrina-wouim?file=/src/App.js

## Summary

I participated in my first hackathon with <a href="https://github.com/MintbeanHackathons">Mintbean</a>! We had about 3-4 hours to make our own markdown editors. It was great practice to use React and learn about new libraries such as showdown and ace editor. It was awesome to see everyone's projects and different skills involved to make a simple markdown editor. I originally created my project using codesandbox.io. Overall, it was a fun experience and I'm excited to do more hackathons with Mintbean and create new projects.
